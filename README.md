# ML/ DL Implementations

This repository is used to maintain easy implementations of all different types of ML and DNN algorithms.

#### **1. Machine Learning models**

1. Supervised Learning

   - Linear regression
   - Logistic regression (classification)
   - Decision Trees
   - SVM
   - K-nearest neibhour (classification & regression, but mainly used for classificaion)
   - Random Forests

2. Unsupervised Learning

   - K means (clustering)

3. Reinforcement Learning

#### **2. Deep Learning models**

- Deep neural network
- Convolutional neural networks(CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
- LSTM

---

**Rules**

- Try to keep the code as simple as possible.
- Use libraries from Keras, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- Document each step properly and explain concepts for beginners.
- Give description and link to the dataset.
- Properly format the structure of the directories
